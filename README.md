# MedidateUI-App
Discover the power of complex SwiftUI gestures as we redefine user interactions with a custom button, surpassing Apple's standard UI library. 
Immerse yourself in the captivating onboarding screen, enhanced by a parallax effect that creates depth through opposing movements.

## Description

This repository houses an iOS app that showcases advanced app design techniques using SwiftUI, Swift, and Xcode. Through this project, we aim to inspire developers by exploring the possibilities offered by the SwiftUI framework. The app incorporates complex SwiftUI gestures, surpassing the capabilities of Apple's stock user interface library, to create a custom button with unique interactions.

One of the standout features of this app is the implementation of a parallax effect on the onboarding screen. By using multiple movements in the opposite direction, we add depth and visual interest to the screen. The result is an immersive experience that captivates users from the moment they launch the app.

To enhance the overall user experience, we have integrated AVFoundation to incorporate sounds into the app. By leveraging haptics and sound effects, we create a more engaging and interactive environment for users.
